Current:
Central Control: Supervisor acts as the central server, handling all allocation decisions.
Graph Model: Uses NetworkX to model the environment grid, allowing for Dijkstra's shortest path routing.
Communication: Utilizes Webots Emitter and Receiver for JSON message passing (requests, status, assignment).
Task Management: Tasks are stored in a Priority Queue (heapq) to ensure higher-priority jobs are considered first.

Future Enhancements
Enforce a 10% battery reserve buffer, rerouting robots to charging if post-task battery falls below threshold.
Use a multi-factor cost model incorporating distance, load, battery, congestion, and expected delays.
Continuously learn each robot’s true speed from telemetry and use it in future ETA and cost predictions.
Provide accurate ETA estimates that combine motion time, pickup time, load-dependent slowdown, and queue delays.
Support dynamic path replanning based on congestion, blockages, and higher-priority reroutes.

Hero Features
Implement self-learning cost refinement, where robots update bidding parameters from historical performance data.
Predict pickup duration using weight-based models (e.g., a simple logistic regression trained from past pick events).
Introduce proximity-aware reassignment, where tasks can be reassigned mid-route if another robot becomes closer or faster.
Compute cost for all robots including busy ones, enabling future-task scheduling rather than idle-only bidding.
Allow priority-aware optimization, where high-priority tasks may preemptively reorder lower-priority ones to minimize system-wide cost.
Explore combinatorial auctions so robots can bid on bundles of tasks when routing synergies reduce total cost.
