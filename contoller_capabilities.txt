Current:
Central Control: Supervisor acts as the central server, handling all allocation decisions.
Graph Model: Uses NetworkX to model the environment grid, allowing for Dijkstra's shortest path routing.
Communication: Utilizes Webots Emitter and Receiver for JSON message passing (requests, status, assignment).
Task Management: Tasks are stored in a Priority Queue (heapq) to ensure higher-priority jobs are considered first.
Enforce a 10% battery reserve buffer, rerouting robots to charging if post-task battery falls below threshold.
Use a multi-factor cost model incorporating distance, load, battery, congestion, and expected delays.
Add the concept of time to cost as well
Provide accurate ETA estimates that combine motion time, pickup time, load-dependent slowdown, and queue delays.
Continuously learn each robot’s true speed from telemetry and use it in future ETA and cost predictions.
Explore combinatorial auctions so robots can bid on bundles of tasks when routing synergies reduce total cost.


Future Enhancements
Support dynamic path replanning based on congestion, blockages, and higher-priority reroutes.
If low priority don't instantly take up but wait for some time

Hero Features
Implement self-learning cost refinement, where robots update bidding parameters from historical performance data.
Compute cost for all robots including busy ones, enabling future-task scheduling rather than idle-only bidding.



Future Reference:
This sophisticated market-based allocation algorithm utilizes a Normalized Time-Energy-Risk Utility Function to calculate a bid price denominated entirely in seconds, ensuring all cost factors are physically comparable and grounded in reality. The algorithm aggregates three primary components: Execution Cost, which measures the travel time required for the pickup and delivery legs, applying a weighted penalty to non-productive "deadheading" (travel to pickup); Recovery Cost, which translates the estimated energy consumption—calculated using the robot's specific, learned motor efficiency—into the future time required to recharge that exact amount of energy; and a Scarcity Risk Barrier, which employs an exponential function to impose a negligible penalty when battery reserves are high but causes the cost to skyrocket mathematically as the energy buffer approaches the critical 10% safety threshold. This aggregated physical cost is finally scaled by the task’s priority, acting as a "willingness to pay" factor that allows high-priority missions to effectively discount the safety margins, ensuring that the fleet automatically balances logistical speed, individual hardware health, and mission urgency without relying on arbitrary magic numbers.

This advanced market-based allocation system transitions the fleet from a simple greedy queue to a Global Batch Auction, evaluating every possible robot-task combination simultaneously to determine the mathematically optimal set of assignments. At its core lies a sophisticated Lifecycle Utility Function that converts all factors—distance, battery scarcity, and hardware efficiency—into a unified currency of time, calculating not just the execution time but also the "Recovery Cost" (future time spent charging) and the physics-based impact of payload weight on energy drain. By enforcing a Full Lifecycle Feasibility check that guarantees a robot can reach a charger after delivery, and integrating a dynamic Task Aging mechanism that progressively discounts the risk cost for neglected requests, the system creates a self-balancing economy that prioritizes urgent missions while preventing low-battery strandings and ensuring no task is ignored indefinitely.
Sequential single-item auctions (SSI auctions), which sequentially allocate targets to robots, require less computing
resources but yield poorer target assignments than combinatorial auctions.
